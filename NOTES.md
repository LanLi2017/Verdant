NOTES

--- reconsider model. maybe cells, output, and snippets should be their own category, also current getNodey is very error prone, so maybe put the type of nodey in the lookup name.

--- get mixins working UI

- start on search, designing what that should look like
  - for now mvp, search should return samples of unique artifacts that match the search

* star nodes are moving to node history. they should never be added to the main data store since they should never be saved to file
